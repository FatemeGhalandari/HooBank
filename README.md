# Project Name: Modern-bank 
Welcome to my project based on the JS Mastery course! In this project, I've created a multi-component and feature-rich website using ReactJS, TailwindCSS, and Vite. This website serves as a practical implementation of the concepts I've learned in the course and showcases my skills in building responsive web applications.
## Features
### • Responsive Design
The website is built using responsive design principles, ensuring a seamless experience across various devices and screen sizes.  
### • Multiple Components 
The project is structured into multiple reusable React components, each responsible for a specific section of the website. This modular approach enhances code maintainability and reusability.
### • Hero Section
The hero section welcomes users with an eye-catching image and a call-to-action button, enticing them to explore further.
### • Testimonials
Real user testimonials are displayed in a carousel format, allowing visitors to read through authentic feedback from satisfied users.
### • Footer
The footer section contains essential links, social media icons, and copyright information.
## Technologies Used
• ReactJS: Used for building the dynamic and interactive components of the website.
