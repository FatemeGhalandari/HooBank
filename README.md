# Project Name: Modern-bank 
Welcome to my project based on the JS Mastery course! In this project, I've created a multi-component and feature-rich website using ReactJS, TailwindCSS, and Vite. This website serves as a practical implementation of the concepts I've learned in the course and showcases my skills in building responsive web applications.
